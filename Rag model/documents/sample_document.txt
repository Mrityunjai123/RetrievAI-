# Sample Document for RAG Testing

## Introduction
This is a sample document created for testing the Offline RAG system. 
The system can process various types of documents including PDF, TXT, DOCX, MD, and CSV files.

## Key Features
1. **Local Processing**: All data stays on your machine
2. **Multiple LLM Support**: Works with Ollama, GPT4All, and LlamaCpp
3. **Persistent Storage**: Your documents and conversations are saved
4. **Semantic Search**: Find relevant information quickly

## How It Works
The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system:
- Splits documents into chunks
- Creates embeddings for semantic search
- Retrieves relevant chunks for your questions
- Generates answers using local LLMs

## Example Questions You Can Ask
- What are the key features of this system?
- How does the RAG system work?
- What types of documents are supported?
- What makes this system offline?

## Technical Details
The system uses:
- FAISS for vector storage
- Sentence Transformers for embeddings
- LangChain for orchestration
- Streamlit for the user interface
